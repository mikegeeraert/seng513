			During the first day, we rode down the Columbia river from Walla Walla, Washington. Riding on the North side of the river, we were able to avoid the busy main highway, although this meant that technically we were in Washington for almost the whole ride. I remember the heat from the 30 degree day was enough to make me uncomfortable, and pushed us to ride faster for more airflow. We tended to stay riding around 70 mph, passing the odd semi-truck on the double lane highway.

			Our second day on the bikes was when the ride really began. We began the day by continuing to follow the Columbia River along the Historic Columbia River Highway. The twisty, busy and slow national park highway was a good chance to sink into our saddles and get used to our bikes as we leaned around tight hairpins and long sweeping corners at low speeds. Climbing up to the top a large mountainous spine, we found ourselves looking back along the Columbia River valley along with many other tourists (including an incredibly large motorcycle motorcade of about 20-30 riders). This is the site of the Vista House Lookout, an old stone lookout tower that has since been relegated to tourism duties and standing tall for photo ops. 
			<br>
			<br>
			We continued west, following secondary highways around the south east side of Portland. After a short, failed attempt to see Mount Hood from a lookout we continued on, starting the plunge south, down the center of the Cascade Mountain range. It wasn't long before we escaped the heavy traffic and entered the Mount Hood National Forest on highway 26. This was my first real taste of the amazing roads that Oregon had to offer. Great pavement, corner after corner and large majestic coniferous trees lulled me into a euphopric trance as we swept from one corner to the next at a spirited pace. The bike seemed to lean on its own and follow the road with almost no input from its rider. I was in Heaven for the first time in Oregon, but not the last. 
			<br>
			<br>
			After a short-lived afternoon of riding, we finally arived at Detroit Lake, where we would camp for the night just steps away from the beach. A beer at the sunset never felt so good.

			Energized from our first sleep in a small backpacking tent on light-duty thermarests, We made oatmeal in a cup and began packing for our big ride out of the mountains to the coast. Sharing a tent with Dad after 2 large bottles of craft beer meant that I would need to pick up ear plugs if we were to carry on trying Oregon's finest brews. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Ambitions drove us directly west out of the mountain range towards the coast. We had a tight schedule, and due to the fires in the area we were unable to drive down the short gravel road to Terwilliger Falls for a short hike. After turning onto Highway 126, we had rejoined the vacation crowd of fast paced traffic filled with campers and family SUVs packed to the rafters with all the 'glamping' necessities.
			<br>
			<br>
			The mountains fell away behind us as we drove through Nimrod, cracking jokes through our radios regarding the inspirational quality of town names in this area. A short time later I'd thought we'd better oil our chains soon. 'Hey Dad, I didn't bring my chain lube, I figured you would have brought yours', I said over the radio, expecting confirmation in my assumption. After a short delay, Dad's plain tone replied 'Oh, I didn't bring mine either. I thought you would have some'.  An unplanned stop in Eugene it was. 
			<br>
			<br>
			After weaving and winding our way through the tight traffic of Eugene, we made it to Florence, the first stop on the coast! Now would be a good time to include a crucial piece of trivia. Dad had learned to ride a motorcycle in the Spring, and probably had not logged more than 40 hours in the saddle before embarking on a 10 day trip on some very challenging roads for very long days of 10 hours or more. This expedited introduction to long distance riding would hamper even the most apt rider, and Dad's endurance to this point was a testament to his natural ability. Still, the twisty roads and busy traffic had taken a toll on Dad's back, making each mile more and more precarious as we continued south towards Gold Beach. Today was becoming a marathon, and a break was all we really needed. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Just south of Florence, Dad realized he forgot his glasses at the gas pump where we filled up our bikes 10 minutes ago. Hastily, we turned off the highway to turn around in an approach. In a brief lapse of fine motor control (no doubt brought on by the fatigue of a long day and his frantic need for 20/20 vision), Dad missed his brake, and with a twist of his wrist, his bike torpedoed right towards its big, blue, motorized target. In a last minute swerve, He narrowly avoided a heap of twisted body work and leather. The only casuality of Dad's Suzuki cruise missile was a small auxillary light on the left side of my motorcycle. Phew.

			After a much needed sleep in a hotel room, we woke and enjoyed a complimentary breakfast complete with gravy and biscuits. Packing our bikes once again, We embarked on another ambitious day. We were so close to California and its iconic Redwood Forest, it was very hard to turn up the opportunity to ride South to Crescent City so we could cross through the Cascades once again, this time surrounded by monsterous redwoods that were so close to the edge of the road it felt like you could reach out and touch them. The descision to extend our day to accomodate the redwoods was made by my now battlehardened companion. I think we both agreed it was the best decision of the day. 
			<br>
			<br> 
			Turning East back into the Cascades, the redwood forest was mesmerizing. These big red trees seemed like immovable giants with bases large enough to make semi-trucks appear as half scale models. We took the opportunity to pull into a camping area to take a picture showcasing the enormity of this lumber against our small motorcycles. On the road, the busy National Forest Service highway began to twist and turn once again, clamping itself tightly to the stone face of the tight mountain valley, with precarious drops to the Smith River creek bed below. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			Despite the busy traffic, we were once again riding an incredible stretch of road, and relishing the relative comfort that the beginning of the day had to offer. As we continued east along the windy river, the cool salty air from the ocean was at our backs, and we were once again being introduced to the hot, dry air that currently plagued Oregon. The smoke from one of the largest fires in the area hung in the air and further intensified the heat. We made good time as we pressed on towards Grants Pass, where we stopped for fuel and water. 
			<br> 
			<br> 
			Wearing black motorcycle gear in 35 degree weather was definitely taxing on the body, and each stop had to be carfully calibrated and executed, since that meant none of that glorious wind chill that came with riding at highway speed. Dad and I were both packing multiple water bottles and staying hydrated on our way through the east end of the Cascade Mountains, towards Crater Lake.
			<br>
			<br>
			We knew we would be camping tonight, but had not yet figured out where. Our ultimate destination was Crater Lake, but we were willing to settle for a campsite earlier, if that meant we would not have to set up in the dark. Ultimately, we ended up making it all the way to Crater Lake, which at the time had a forest fire raging only 1-2 miles from the campsites. We managed to obtain one of the last sites available for the night, and set up camp underneath a constant ash fall. No joke. There was a film of ash on anything that sat out for 10 minutes. I was finally able to relate to Ben Stiller's blacklung in the movie Zoolander, albiet he definitely had it worse than me. Burgers and beer underneath the apocolyptic glow of a nearby fire was a great way to end another enourmous day on the bikes.

			Due to our late arrival the night before, we were unable to see Crater Lake in good light and the direction of the wind meant it would more than likely be socked in anyway. We elected to wake up early and visit the lake in the morning, before the local fire warmed up and filled the air with smoke once again. If we were really lucky, a morning inversion might also trap that smoke low in the valley, and keep the top of the Crater clear for photos. Dad and I arrived at the top of the crater just in time. Slightly ahead of the tourism traffic and fire activity, we had relatively clear shots of the lake and actually saw blue sky! Our strategy had worked out, and we were able to get these really cool hazy shots of the lake as we rode around the perimeter of the crater. 
			<br>
			<br>
			After our tour around Oregon's most famous lake, we continued on, back down and south east, until we met up with Highway 97 that would take us north towards Bend. Dad and I had both neglected to fill up on gas at the Crater Lake Campground since, well, in our experience, this great capitalistic american state seemed to have a gas station strategically placed every 30 miles or so. Not the case today. We drove until both our bikes were flashing their gas symbols, urging us to refill with more dinosaur squeezings soon, or perish. With no choice but to ride on until we found gasoline, we ducked our heads behind the windshields for less wind resistance, and minimized passing. Dad was talking to his phone as we rode, bringing up the closest gas stations he could find. It was not until we rolled into a Chevron in Chemult that we were able to quench the bikes thirst for dino juice. I imagined the bikes making the straw sucking noise as we coasted to a stop in front of the pumps. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Our next stop was at Lava River Cave, which is a 1.5 km long cave that was created during a lava flow, probably around the prehistoric time period Mick Jager was born in. Being 35 degrees out on the highway, we didn't think we would need much in the way of jackets, but this sub-terrainian tube maintains a constant 5.6 degrees C, which feels incredibly cold after spending a few days under Oregon's giant heat lamp. We were already an hour or so behind in our day, and we walked briskly through the cave in order to squeeze it into our day.
			<br>
			<br>
			During our stop at the caves, I began eyeing up a route that would take us around the south-east side of Bend. It was called the "Crooked River Highway" and people had praised the scenic nature of this secondary highway and its amazing twists and turns. It looked great with no mention of gravel, which made it much more approachable for newer riders like Dad. We set off and road north to join up with Interstate 20, which lead us east to the beginning of (hopefully) the best road of the day. However, when we met up with the beginning of "Crooked River Highway", it didn't seem like much of a highway at all. In fact it was gravel, in the middle of nowhere. It was quickly becoming late in the day, and without time to turn around and go back, I had lead us into a trap. I knew that riding gravel as a new rider is a difficult task, and Dad's back was already in pain from days of tense riding. Gravel makes bikes feel very floaty, and washboard and ruts will pull your tires around as if it is a train following tracks. I never received formal training, but had riden gravel before and learned to just let my bike wander a little, and only give slight corrections when it was moving too far off my intended direction. This is not natural though and not something you want to learn in a rush, with sore muscles. Dad, although a little weary, agreed that it was our best option so we began our ride down my poorly researched route.
			<br>
			<br>
			The gravel seemed to go on and on as we rode through dry, arid country with no cell reception. We passed the odd barn or approach that was obviously used for cattle ranching. I could hear in Dad's voice over the radio that this was a difficult ride and the pain was getting worse. We stopped a couple times for a brief break, to let his muscles relax. We considered turning around, but the sun was dropping fast the map suggested our best bet was to keep moving forward. After what felt like 50 miles of gravel, the road finally turned to broken pavement. Broken Pavement! It was like riding on a cloud with really, really good mechanical grip. The bikes finally stopped rattling and you didn't have to fight a million little stones to stay in the right direction. This was just the thing we needed, and it just kept getting better. Our average speed went from something like 40 km/h to more like 80. The broken pavement turned to new pavement, and we found ourselves following the Crooked River in an unbeleivably picturesque sandstone desert valley. This was what I imagined should be on an Oregon postcard. The river to our left was slow moving and shallow; it looked like liquid glass covering colorful river rock. On either side of the bank was lush, green grass and small shrubs and trees. The hills above juxtaposed the oasis at their base, with sandstone spines covered with dry, brown grass and withered plants. These desert hills towering above a slow moving, colorful river at the bottom was something I had never seen before and it was incredible. All that gravel was finally worth it, and had we known it was gravel eariler, we probably would not have ever seen this surreal stretch of highway.
