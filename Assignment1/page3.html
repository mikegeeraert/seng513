			<p>My Name is Michael Geeraert and I am currently in my final year of studies in software engineering at the University of Calgary. I am passionate about efficiency and robustness in technical design. I am a firm believer that a life full of different interests and experiences will equip me with the knowledge base required to use a unique and effective approach to solving problems. Motorcycling is a growing hobby of mine, especially adventure riding. I find that this style of riding combines long distance travel with the challenges that come with camping and self reliance in the backcountry. The trip to Oregon on a pair of motorcycles was an incredible opportunity to see an amazing state in very close proximity to nature. There were many lessons around packing, planning, patience and adaptability learned through this trip, some of which I will carry with me on many future adventures.</p>
